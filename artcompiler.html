About Art Compiler
</p>

<p class="text">
Art Compiler was founded by <a href="jeffdyer.html">Jeff Dyer</a> for the purpose of making languages
for creative expression. 

Jeff has spent his career designing and implementing general purpose programming languages. As a lead
developer of ActionScript at Adobe Systems, he became fascinated with how language can be used to
express meaning outside of the computer.

</p>
<p class="text">
This movitvated Jeff to read widely about art, especially modern and contemporary art. He is inspired
by the early graffiti writers of New York who expressed themselves by simply writing their names in
public. He is influenced by artist as varied as Cezanne, Picasso, Kandinsky, Pollock, Escher,
LeWitt and Reas. He studied the writings of thinkers such as Nelson Goodman, Christopher Alexander,
A. N. Whitehead, and Douglas Hofstadter. 

</p>
<p class="text">
Furthermore, while at Adobe, Jeff was exposed to the works of Flash developers and artists such as
Andre Michelle, Erik Natzke, Ralph Hauwert, Keith Peters, Joa Ebert, Joshua Davis, Mario Klingeman,
and others who were able to make beautiful and interesting things with ActionScript, the language
he helped create.
</p>
<p class="text">
It is in this context that the vision behind Art Compiler, of seeing language as
an expressive medium, was born.
</p>

<p class="text">
Art Compiler is located in Mountain View, California.
