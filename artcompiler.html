About Art Compiler.
</p>

<p class="text">
Art Compiler was founded by <a href="jeffdyer.html">Jeff Dyer</a> on the premise that computers are
language machines with the power to express meaning in domains of human knowledge and experience. 

Jeff has spent his career designing programming languages and developing compilers. As a lead
developer of ActionScript at Adobe Systems, he became facinated with how language can be used to
express meaning outside of the computer.

</p>
<p class="text">
Over the course of several years, Jeff read widely about art, especially modern
and contemporary art. He is inspired by the early graffiti writers of New York who expressed
themselves by simply writing their names in public places. He has been influenced by artist as
varied as Cezanne, Picasso, Kandinsky, Pollock, Escher, LeWitt and Casey Reas. He has studied the writings of thinkers such as Nelson Goodman, Christopher Alexander, A. N. Whitehead, and Douglas Hofstadter. 

Jeff was also impressed by the works of Flash developers/artists such as Andre Michelle, Erik Natzke,
Ralph Hauwert, Keith Peters, Joa Ebert, Joshua Davis, Mario Klingeman, and others who were able to make
beautiful and interesting graphics with ActionScript, the language he had helped create.
</p>

<p class="text">
It is in this context that Art Compiler was founded for the purpose of making languages for creative expression.
</p>
<p class="text">
Art Compiler is located in Mountain View, California.
