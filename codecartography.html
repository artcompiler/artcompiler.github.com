Code Cartography
</p>

<p class="text">
Code Cartography is the practice of creating maps of software source code. Through interactive
visualization, users are able to see at once the meaning of orders of magnitude more code than is
possible through conventional text based tools. They are able to see syntax and semantics from
the level of modules down to the level basic blocks. They are able to select a variety of semantic
graphs including those depicting reference dependencies, call graphs, class inheritance, module
dependencies, control flow, data flow, profile information, code coverage.
</p>

<p class="text">
Code maps are built on three types of views. The syntax view displays an expandable abstract syntax
tree, which allows users to move between levels of program detail. The text view shows the formatted text
of the code, which allows users to see just the code that is of interest
during a particular investigation. The third and most powerful view is the semantic view, which allows
users to see various semantic relationships between selected parts of the program. These three views
are linked so that a selection in one view will cause the other views to be updated to represent the same
parts of the program.
</p>

<p class="text">
<b>Syntax View</b>. The syntax view refracts code through the grammar of its language. Selecting a
node in the tree graph expands or retracts that node. The syntax view allows parts of the program
to be seen in the context of the whole program. Selecting a node in the tree view highlights that
node in the other views. Figure 1 illustrates the tree view.

of the property 'localStorage'.</span>
</p>

<p class="text">
<b>Text View</b>. The text view provides a formatted, highlighted view the original source text, and 
elides details that are not significant to the current point-of-view. The text view provides a bridge between
the original code and the other, more abstract views. It is complete and compatible with the source
code being mapped. Figure 2 illustrates the text view.

</p>


<p class="text">
<b>Semantic View</b>. The semantic view refracts code through the semantics of the language. This
includes static analysis performed by a compiler, as well as by dynamic profiling and even user
annotations. Semantic views are generated off-line by compiler plugins. The relationships
represented are limited only by what can be shown in a network graph. Figure 3 shows an example
of a semantic view.

</p>

<p class="text">
<b>One Model, Three Views</b>. These three views are backed by the same core data structures. Each
is indexed by the nodes of the abstract syntax tree. Navigating in one view is reflected in the
other views. Selection in all three views is constrained by the range of nodes in the syntax tree.
For example, a user can select the body of a function in the text view by clicking within that
function until the whole body is selected. The syntax view will show the relationship of that
function to the rest of the tree in both directions. The semantic view will show the semantics of
the function as it relates to code outside the function.
</p>

<p class="text">
Each view affords some level of user control over the formatting and highlighting. For example, the code
formatting and highlighting in the text view and the color scheme for nodes and edges in the various
graph views are controlled by standard or custom preferences. 
</p>

<p class="text">
<b>Commissions and Collaborations</b>.

We seek commissions for Code Cartography works, as well as collaborations that improve
this practice. The following are a few such projects we have in mind:

<ul class="text">
<li>
Working with language designers to develop off-line compiler plugins that generate views for code
in their language. Of particular interest are plugins that do advanced static analysis.
</li>
<li>
Working with open source software projects to create visual maps for their repositories. The map generation
process is fully automated so what is missing is the hosting infrastructure.
</li>
<li>
Working with testing organizations to create visual code coverage browsers. With each new build, a code map
will be produced that projects code coverage data onto the syntax, text and semantic views of the source code.
</li>
<li>
Working with computer science educators to provide online tools for understanding code. In addition to providing
syntax and semantic views of programs student write, code maps can highlight defects through lint-like analysis.
</li>
</ul>
