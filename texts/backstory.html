<b class="title">The Backstory</b>
</p>

<p class="prose">
Art Compiler is my attempt to scratch a long suffered and persistent itch. That itch is best
captured by the question "How does language mean?" Quite simply, I'm facinated by how language
carries meaning, and what kinds of meaning it carries.
</p>

<p class="prose">
This urge first manifested itself as an interest in computational linguistics, which led to a
general interest in language processing and finally to programming language compilers. After a two
decade detour into the trenches of compiler writing and programming language design, I find myself
with both the skills for and the interest in developing ways to probe language for meaning that can
be represented visually.
</p>

<p class="prose">
A program is nothing more than a complex network with it nodes given by the syntax of the program,
and its edges given by various context senstive relationships between those nodes. Our job is to
discover and represent that network visually so that the program's meaning becomes clear to an
observer.
</p>

<p class="prose">
At Art Compiler, we use a collection of compilers and data visualization tools to produce works that combine static
and dynamic graphics into an interactive whole. At the core of every visualization is a data base of
facts about a program, not unlike what optimizing compilers use. This data base is built and 
elaborated through a series of phases that synthesize new facts from internal and external sources.
Finally, the network represented in the data is rendered as a collection of static images which are
manipulated interactively by the users through a dynamic interface.
